- 👋 Hi, I’m @MCTaku1509!
- 👀 I'm still deciding what I am interested in career wise. But at the moment I'm interested at becoming proficient at my first language, Python and making transitions to other languages
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a Masters conversion course in Computing (designed for students who have never coded before)
- 💞️ I’m looking to just put myself on the public domain. Share my work, get some feedback on how to improve it, use that feedback to learn and grow as a programmer
- 📫 You can reach me by sending me a message on LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com/in/mark-charimari) or on Discord @MCTaku1509
